Git hub Essentials

1. Create a git hub account.
2. Create a Repository with README (This README is an optional)
3. Using the terminal, create a folder in your home directory.
4. Navigate to that home folder using the terminal.
5. Enter : git clone <your repository web address (just copy and paste)>
6. Now your local folder is synchronized with the github repository.
7. You can work on a file in your local folder and push it to the repository using the following steps.
7a) Save your local file in the local folder.
7b) Enter : git commit -m<your comment regarding the file/update>
7c) git push (it may ask you the password of your github account)
8. Then you can share that repository with your collaborators. 
9. To update your local folder type “git pull” on the terminal (make sure you are in your local folder in the terminal).
10.) There is a method to work on the same copy of the “master”, which is called “branch”. We can use “git checkout <branch name>” to switch between branches.
11.) Once the branches are reviewed the owner can edit the “master” or he/she can merge the corresponding “branch” to the master.
